# Budget App 💸

Budget App is a React-based application that helps you take control of your finances. You can add various types of incomes and expenses (organized by categories and subcategories) and manage multiple accounts. Whenever you add an income or expense, it updates the selected account accordingly. The main page displays your total balance across incomes, expenses, and accounts, so you always know where you stand financially.
